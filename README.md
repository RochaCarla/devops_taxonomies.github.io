## Public Repository for the research "Harmonizing DevOps Taxonomies: A Grounded Theory Study"

**Objective:** This paper presents empirical research on the structure of DevOps teams in softwareproducing organizations. The goal is to better understand the organizational structure and characteristics of teams adopting DevOps by harmonizing the existing knowledge. 

**Method:** To do this, we conducted a grounded theory study by analyzing existing studies on DevOps teams and taxonomies (some of these studies conduct grounded theory in turn).
